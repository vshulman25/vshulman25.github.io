# 1:Responsive Portfolio

For this assignment, I was tasked with building my initial portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. This portfolio is the start of my career in web development - I am eager and excited to improve this portfolio in the upcoming months.

## Description 

The purpose of this assignment was to build a responsive webpage with the following files - index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html - styled with CSS in an external sheet linked within each page. My page boasts working Bootstrap elements as well as a navigation bar that stays on all pages and toggles with working links.

In addition to the layout being responsive, all images included respond properly and when reduced to a small enough screen, the navigation bar will collapse to a hamburger style. I have included personal touches throughout the webpage including some facts about myself and a bit of my favorite color.
