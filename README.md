# 2: Code Refactor

This is my first homework assignment, I refactored the code I was initially given and presented the client with a cleaner version for both the HTML file and CSS file.

## Description 

The purpose of this assignment is to provide a codebase that follows accessibility standards making the site more optimized for search engines. Throughout the file you will find semantic html elements that follow in a logical structure. I have also included my notes on both the HTML and CSS files. Other elements of this assignment included organizing the CSS file, ensuring all links loaded with no errors and ensuring that the website was accessible for all.
